To deploy your combined Spring Boot and Angular application to the cloud, you can use a cloud service provider like AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Azure. 
Here's a brief example using AWS:

To deploy our multithreaded application to AWS:

First we need to Create an AWS Account.
Secondly, we need to
Set Up ECR (Elastic Container Registry): Create a repository in ECR to store Docker images and push built Docker image to this repository.
lastly, we need to
Set Up ECS (Elastic Container Service): Create an ECS cluster and define a task definition that uses our Docker image from ECR. Then, create a service based on this task definition to run our application in containers.

This setup allows our application to be easily managed and scaled in the cloud.
